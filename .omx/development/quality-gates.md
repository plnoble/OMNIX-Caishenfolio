# Quality Gates

Use this file before risky changes, handoff, delivery, or release. Apply only relevant categories and mark the rest as N/A.

Statuses:

- Pass: verified with evidence.
- Warn: partial coverage or residual risk.
- Fail: issue must be fixed or explicitly deferred.
- N/A: not relevant to this project or change.

## Pre-Change Gate

- Objective, dependencies, risks, impact scope, and acceptance criteria are clear.
- Existing worktree state has been inspected.
- Affected files or modules are identified.
- Verification approach is known before implementation starts.
- Security, privacy, data, API, frontend, or release-sensitive areas are flagged when relevant.

## Pre-Delivery Gate

### Security and Privacy

- Inputs are validated and outputs are encoded where applicable.
- Secrets, tokens, passwords, and PII are not logged or committed.
- Authentication and authorization changes are reviewed for least privilege.
- File paths, uploads, system commands, and outbound requests are checked for injection or traversal risk.

### Data, API, and Consistency

- Schema changes use migrations where applicable.
- API shape, versioning, validation, pagination, and idempotency are reviewed when applicable.
- Money uses integer minor units or decimal types, never binary floating point.
- Time storage and transfer use UTC when the project handles time-sensitive data.

### Code Quality and Maintainability

- The change follows existing project patterns.
- Duplication, dead code, broad types, empty catches, and unhandled TODO/FIXME/HACK comments are reviewed.
- Error handling is explicit and does not silently swallow failures.
- Configuration is separated from code and required config fails fast.

### Testing and Verification

- Unit, integration, E2E, or manual verification is selected according to risk.
- Boundary cases and regression scenarios are covered where relevant.
- Verification commands and results are recorded in `current.md` or `handoff.md`.
- Known unverified areas are stated explicitly.

### Frontend, Accessibility, and UX

- Loading, empty, error, and boundary states are handled when UI is affected.
- Keyboard access, labels, alt text, focus visibility, and color contrast are checked when UI is affected.
- Mobile layout and user-visible text are checked when frontend behavior changes.

### Operations, Dependencies, and Release

- Dependency changes are reviewed for lockfiles, unused packages, vulnerabilities, and licenses.
- Logs, metrics, health checks, retries, timeouts, graceful shutdown, and rate limits are considered when relevant.
- README, API docs, ADRs, changelog, release notes, or migration notes are updated when needed.
- Rollback or recovery path is known for risky delivery.
